# iOS Sideloading Docs

## 1. Using a PC (Free)

### Additional Info
- An Apple ID (an Apple account) is its own certificate but with limitations.  
- This method also needs iTunes and the old iCloud app.

### Limitations
- Apps need to be refreshed before 7 days pass or they will need to be reinstalled.  
- The device needs to be connected to a PC during installation.  
- This method is limited to only three sideloaded apps.  
- Push notifications don't work.  
- Deep linking doesn't work.  
  - Example: `https://open.spotify.com` wonâ€™t open the app but send you to the Safari webpage.  
  - On the other hand, `spotify://` will work.
