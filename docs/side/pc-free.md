# Method 1: Using a PC (Free)

## Additional Info
- An Apple ID (Apple account) acts as its own certificate but has limitations.
- Requires iTunes and the old iCloud app installed.

## Limitations
- Apps need to be refreshed every 7 days.
- Device must be connected to a PC during installation.
- 3 app limit.
- No push notifications.
- No in-app link opening (e.g., tapping a Reddit link won’t open the Reddit app).

## Services
- **AltStore** – Installs via its own app (counts as 1 of the 3 slots).
- **SideStore** – Uses a WireGuard VPN trick to sign apps without a PC. Setup is more complex.
- **Sideloadly** – Signs & installs from a PC; uses all 3 slots.

This method is the easiest and cheapest way to get started with sideloading.
