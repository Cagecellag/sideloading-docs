# Buying a Apple Developer Account

Buying a dev account costs 99 EUR and expires every year. A paid dev account is made for the people that make apps for the app store, 
though this can be exploited to sideload any app you wish.

---

## Requirements
- A valid **Apple ID** (this will become your developer certificate).  
- A **Mac or Windows PC** with iTunes and iCloud installed (for installing signed apps).  
- An active **Apple Developer Account** subscription (€99 per year).  
- Access to **Xcode** *(optional but useful for app signing and debugging)*.  
- A USB cable to connect your device.  

---

## Additional Info & Limitations
- Your Apple ID becomes your **developer certificate**, meaning all apps you sign are trusted for a full year.  
- Certificates **expire every 365 days**, requiring renewal to keep apps working.  
- Unlike the free method, there is **no 3-app limit**.  
- Apps do **not need to be refreshed weekly** — you can install them once and keep them indefinitely (as long as the certificate remains valid).  
- You still need a PC or Mac for initial installation, unless using a service that supports direct sideloading.  
- Some advanced developer features, like on-device debugging and provisioning profiles, are available with this account.

---

## Benefits
- Apps behave **exactly like App Store apps** — full system access, push notifications, and working in-app links.  
- Allows you to sideload **unlimited apps**.  
- Full **background activity** and **auto-refresh** support.  
- Your apps appear fully trusted in settings (no “Untrusted Developer” warnings).  
- Perfect for power users, testers, or developers who build and maintain custom apps.

## Recommended Tools

### [**AltStore (Developer Mode)**](https://altstore.io/)
- Supports direct installation using your Apple Developer credentials.  
- Removes the 3-app limit and 7-day refresh restriction.  
- You can install as many apps as you want, with automatic background refresh if Wi-Fi sync is configured.

### [**Sideloadly (Developer Signing)**](https://sideloadly.io/)
- Works seamlessly with developer accounts.  
- Offers advanced customization: change app name, icon, bundle ID, and more.  
- You can even export IPA files without installing them immediately.  
- Ideal for managing multiple signed apps efficiently.

---

## Tips
- Keep track of your **certificate expiration date** to avoid apps suddenly failing to open.  
- If you’re testing apps across multiple devices, make sure to **register those devices** under your developer account in advance.  
- Always **revoke unused certificates** to maintain clean account hygiene and avoid conflicts.  
- Use **Xcode** if you want to debug or sign apps directly on macOS.  
- If you maintain a small personal library of apps, this method is more cost-effective long-term than relying on unstable enterprise certs.

## Summary
Using a **paid Apple Developer Account** is the most official and stable way to sideload apps:

- ✅ **No 3-app limit**  
- ✅ **No weekly refreshes**  
- ✅ **Full app functionality** — notifications, links, background activity  
- ❌ **Costs €99/year**, renewable annually  

It’s the perfect balance between **freedom** and **security**, especially for users who sideload often or develop their own apps.
