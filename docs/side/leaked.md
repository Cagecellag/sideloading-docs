# Method 4: Using Leaked Certificates

## Additional Info
- Leaked enterprise certificates get shared around but are unreliable.
- They usually last only a few days before Apple revokes them.

## Limitations
- Extremely short lifespan (often under 3 days).
- Same technical limitations as regular enterprise certificates.
- Rarely available.

## Services That Sometimes Offer Them
- **Scarlet** – Controversial because of its reliance on leaked certs.
- **AppDB** – Widely criticized for reliability issues.
- Certain Discord servers sometimes announce them.

## Conclusion
This method is **not recommended**. It’s unstable, apps stop working quickly, and trust is low.
