# Method 3: Buying an Enterprise Certificate

**This is my personal preferred method.**

## Additional Info
- Enterprise certificates are intended for companies distributing apps internally.
- Services can purchase them (€99) and resell access, usually supporting up to 100 devices.
- Apple doesn’t regulate these as tightly, so many sideloading providers rely on them.
- Does not require a PC, but costs money.

## Limitations
- No hyperlink support (e.g., tapping a Reddit link won’t open the app).
- Risk of your certificate being revoked by Apple.
- Certificates expire yearly, sometimes earlier if unlucky.
- No support for switching app icons while the app is installed.

## Trusted Services
Community-recommended sellers and prices (approximate):
- **FlekSt0r** (€15) – my current choice.
- **Signulous** (€20).
- **Krave Sign** (€7).
- **AppTesters** (€15) – has a “lifetime” option (renewed yearly).
- **DxSign** (€5, no revoke protection).

⚠️ Many other sellers exist, but trust is a big issue. Stick to the known names above.

## Tools I Use
- **FlekSt0re** – Website-based installer, good for loading other tools.
- **Scarlet** – Very fast and easy signing/installation.
- **Feather** – Lets you deeply customize apps (name, packages, etc.).

Enterprise certificates are a good middle ground between free accounts and expensive developer accounts.
