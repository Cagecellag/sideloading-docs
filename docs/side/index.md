## Shit i might want to add:

not the app, it fucked the service sideways. Ok so basically there are bunch of services that cell distribution certs which they buy 99euros for each and they can also be used for 100 devices, and because kravasign is a big service which was trusted they grew extremely large fast. What you also have to remember, apple sometimes does these revoke waves where they revoke a bunch of certificates from services which in return doesnâ€™t allow you to open or install any apps with that certificate. And because apple decides to do the biggest ban wave yet they chose to do it to kravasign. Later the kravasign team found out apple wa able to track every installed app so it was super easy for them to know if its a sold cert by a service. This revoke wave had about i think 70% certificates revoked from them (edited)

distribution certs are usually used by companies to load company apps onto a company device

and celling them is against the tos

apple has extra motivation from companies too to in force this rule, like google, they always crack down on ad blockers and when they see ios sideloading has built in add blockers they might pressure apple to in force the sideloading rule (edited)

in short sideloading is just a big fuck you to apple
