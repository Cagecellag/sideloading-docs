# 404 – Page Not Found

🚨 Uh oh… you’ve sideloaded yourself into the void.  
The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist (or maybe it got revoked by Apple 😉).

## Don’t worry, here are your options:
- 🔙 [Go back to Home](index.md)
- 📚 Browse all [Sideloading Methods](index.md#methods)
- 🔍 Use the search bar (top right) to find what you need

## Fun fact
Just like enterprise certs, some pages don’t last forever.  
But unlike Apple revoking your cert after 3 days, this page will always be here to greet you with a smile.
